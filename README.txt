Finite Automata Library Package (fixed)
======================================

This package contains:
- original_revided_3rd_oct_2025_patched.html  (your uploaded HTML, unmodified)
- index.html  (patched copy with Library UI injected and loader script)
- index_patched_conservative.html (same as index.html)
- library-loader.js
- library.json (sample)
- append_solution.py
- README.txt

If index.html still doesn't work as expected, open original_revided_3rd_oct_2025_patched.html to inspect, or replace the injected panel's HTML in index.html.

To host:
- Upload all files to your GitHub repo root and enable GitHub Pages (if desired).
- Update LIB_URL in library-loader.js to point to a remote library file if you prefer.
